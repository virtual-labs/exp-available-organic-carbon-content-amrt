      "question": "Which of the following is a main significance of soil analysis?",

        "a": "Correct. This is a major benefit of soil analysis.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Soil analysis reduces environmental impact.",
        "c": "Incorrect. It helps to evaluate soil fertility.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It helps predict nutritional requirements."
